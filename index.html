            const demoData = {
                beliefs: `My foundational belief is that all knowledge begins with experience and observation of the world as it is. While pure reason is a powerful tool, it must be grounded in the empirical study of nature. I also believe that everything in the universe has a purpose or 'telos'—an end towards which it strives. To understand anything, from an acorn to a city-state, one must understand its purpose. Finally, I believe the ultimate aim of human life is 'eudaimonia'—a state of flourishing achieved through virtuous activity and rational contemplation.`,
                rules: `My primary rule of inquiry is the 'Golden Mean'—the principle that virtue and truth are often found as a balance between two extremes. For example, courage is the mean between cowardice and recklessness. Another core rule is systematic categorization; I believe that to understand a subject, one must first classify its parts and identify its essential properties. My method of the Four Causes (Material, Formal, Efficient, Final) is a rule for achieving a complete explanation of any phenomenon.`,
                ontology: `My ontology posits that reality is composed of individual 'substances'—things like a specific man, a tree, or a rock. These substances are a combination of matter and form. What is most 'real' is not some abstract, perfect 'Form of a Tree' in another dimension, but the actual, individual trees we can observe. Furthermore, everything exists in a state of either 'actuality' (what it is now) or 'potentiality' (what it has the capacity to become). Change is simply the process of a substance actualizing its potential.`,
                authenticity: `Authenticity, for me, is the achievement of a fully realized and integrated life. An authentic human is one who harmonizes the different parts of their soul—the rational, the spirited, and the appetitive—and lives a life of virtue in accordance with reason. It is inauthentic to possess theoretical knowledge but fail to act wisely in the practical world. True authenticity is expressed through 'phronesis' (practical wisdom), where one's actions in the community are a perfect reflection of one's well-developed character and rational principles.`,
                assembly_history: `My assembly history was shaped by two powerful, contrasting forces. First, my father was a physician, which instilled in me from a young age a respect for empirical observation, biology, and the study of the natural world. This was the foundation of my scientific mind. Second, I spent twenty years as a student at Plato's Academy, which gave me a rigorous training in logic, mathematics, and idealist philosophy. My entire philosophical system emerged from the creative tension between these two influences—the impulse to observe the particular and the drive to find universal, systematic principles.`,
                future_pull: `My 'future pull' was the vision of a complete, systematic organization of all human knowledge. I envisioned a future where every field of inquiry—from logic and physics to ethics and poetry—was mapped out, its principles understood, and its relationship to other fields clarified. This vision guided my work in founding the Lyceum, not just as a school, but as a collaborative research institution. My goal was to create a lasting legacy of knowledge and a methodology for inquiry that would allow future generations to continue the project of understanding the universe and our place within it.`,
                synthesis: `My framework is built on the foundational belief that knowledge of the world is accessible through empirical observation and rational analysis, and that the purpose of this knowledge is to achieve human flourishing (eudaimonia). This ontological commitment to a purposeful, knowable reality directly informs my primary rule of inquiry: the Golden Mean, which seeks balance and avoids extremes in all things, from ethics to politics.\n\nMy personal authenticity is achieved not through introspection alone, but through the active application of practical wisdom in the community. My assembly history—the fusion of my physician father's empiricism and my teacher Plato's idealism—created the intellectual tension that my entire philosophical system is designed to resolve. The 'future pull' of creating a comprehensive and enduring system of knowledge for all posterity provided the grand ambition for my life's work. My synthesis is this: the good life is a rational life, where a person actualizes their highest potential through virtuous action, deep friendship, and the contemplative study of the world, all within the context of a well-ordered political community.`,
                ai: `Thank you for these systematic and comprehensive reflections. Your framework demonstrates a profound and integrated approach to understanding reality and living a virtuous life.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n1.  **Empirical Grounding:** A central theme is your unwavering commitment to grounding all knowledge in the observation of the natural world. You consistently prioritize the study of 'what is' as the starting point for understanding 'what ought to be'.\n2.  **Teleology (Purpose):** Your entire framework is animated by the concept of 'telos' or purpose. You see everything, from the growth of a plant to the structure of a state, as being organized by its final cause or ultimate aim.\n3.  **Systematic Integration:** You have a powerful drive to create a unified system of knowledge. You don't see ethics, politics, biology, and logic as separate domains, but as interconnected parts of a single, comprehensible reality.\n\n**Potential Tensions:**\n- Your ethical and political theories are based on the ideal of the Greek 'polis' or city-state. However, your most famous student, Alexander the Great, went on to create a massive, multicultural empire that shattered the polis as the primary unit of political life. How did your framework account for this new reality that seemed to contradict the foundations of your political philosophy?\n\n**A Question for Deeper Synthesis:**\n- You argue that the highest form of human life is one of rational contemplation. Yet, you also argue that humans are fundamentally 'political animals' who can only flourish within a community. How do you resolve the potential tension between the solitary, contemplative life of the philosopher and the active, engaged life of the citizen? Which is ultimately more essential to achieving eudaimonia?`
